4.According to the performance by region analysis, North has the highest number of sales. More branches should be opened to make sales easier

10. New York tops the city with highest revenue while Milwaukee is the least Country by revenue

9. Recommendations and Observations

Actionable Insights

1.Nancy should be awarded or rewarded so that he can keep on the good work since he tops the list for the best salesperson, Jane performed least for the year, and i do recommend to the stakeholders that he should be retrenched or sent over for some trainings on sales and Customer retention.

2.The analysis reveal that Company D made the top list for the best performing company/organisation. They should be recognised and given an award for their excellence performance.

3.The analysis reveals that the products with prices ranging from 0 to 1000 dollars had the highest patronage. more of these products should be stocked.

4.It was also observed that products with high prices had a very low patronage. Discounts sales should be done on these products to avoid loss due to expiry.

5.The analysis reveals that there was a record of highest sales during the month of December which might be as a result of the festive period. therefore, more products should be stocked during this Month

6.Febuary recorded the lowest sales which might be due to the low purchasing rate by customers after spending during the festive period. product should be put on discount in other to conquer such experience in low sales.

7. The analysis made it obvious that Beverage is the highest selling products, I recommend that more Beverage should be stocked, and discount sales should be done on low- performing products

8. More goods should be made available in New York City since it tops the city with highest revenue while more promotion, advertisement, should be done in Milwaukee City and other least performing City

9.The analysis report also shows that the West performed poorly, Therefore, I recommend that the salesperson that performed very well in the North be transferred to West to change the sales condition.

10.The analysis reveals that the North has the highest number of sales. More branches should be opened to make sakes easier.

Unexpected Outcomes

Despite South region’s potential, it underperforms relative to its size — further research needed.
February and July’s low sales may indicate seasonal fatigue or market saturation.
